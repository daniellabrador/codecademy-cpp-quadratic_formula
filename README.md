# **Quadratic Formula**

The Quadratic Formula program will compute the roots of an equation. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in applying the knowledge I learned in learning to declare variables using C++.

## Project Prompt

In algebra, a quadratic equation is an equation having the form:

![Quadratic equation](./resources/img/quadratic-equation.png)

Graphing, we get the curve below:

![Graph](./resources/img/graph.gif)

The corresponding x values are the x-intercepts of the graph, while a, b, and c are constants.

Write a C++ program called `quadratic.cpp` that solves the quadratic equation for the xâ€˜s:

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download initials.cpp.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

```git
g++ dog_years.cpp -o dog_years
./dog_years
```

## Sources

The techniques utilized was based on the lessons taught in [Codecademy's Learn C++ Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus
). The challenge is also provided by Codecademy.
